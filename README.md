## Description:

### Genres: 
Coop, Multiplayer, Platformer, Puzzle
  
### Summary: 
  - Our game focuses on interaction between players. Another major part of PicoPico is puzzle, which players need to interact with others to solve.
  - To enable interaction, we use Netcode for Gameobjects to implement multiplayer functionality, and Lobby combined with Relay service is used for online room management.
  - The story of our game focuses on education about the effect of invasive species have on the local environemnt. The main motivation behind the story is the incident that my garden (in Cam Ranh, Khanh Hoa) was invaded by snails because my father carelessly mixed the soil (with snails) and the healthy soil together.
